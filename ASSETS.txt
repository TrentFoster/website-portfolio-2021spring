Pitt shield: I am claiming fair use for this asset. It is not the main focus of my webpage and is mainly just there to
show the school that I went to for employers to see. https://www.technology.pitt.edu/sites/default/files/link-img/Pitt%20Shield.png


Youtube video: This is a work that I put together myself and have permissions on the youtube profile as well, therefore
I believe I should have permission to use it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ePRhTvHRX4
