Hello! This website that I created is dedicated to showing off the accomplishments that I will achieve in the future. I wanted to get
this started now so that I had one less thing to worry about in the summer while I started some projects that I have been dying
to do. Be sure to check back in the future to see all that I have been able to do in terms of apps, websites, and any other sort 
of cool projects that I may dive into in the technology world. The (digital) world is my oyster and I want to explore all the digital world has
offer me!
